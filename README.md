Project Overview
---

In this project, I will build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app.
